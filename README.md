## Project Description

This project is a solo exploration into building a chatbot powered by Agentic AI that can answer questions based on uploaded Canvas LMS documentation. The chatbot utilizes document embeddings, retrieval-based QA, and a Streamlit interface to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries.

---

## My Project Idea

I built a **Canvas LMS Q&A assistant** that allows users to upload official documentation (e.g., `.txt` or `.pdf` files exported from Canvas help guides) and ask natural language questions. The chatbot retrieves relevant passages using embeddings and FAISS-based vector search, then generates concise answers using a language model.

---

## Plan & Approach

As a solo developer, I approached the project in manageable phases:

1. **Define** the scope: Q&A from Canvas documentation.
2. **Prepare** the documents (text format) for ingestion.
3. **Build** the Streamlit interface for uploading files and submitting questions.
4. **Load** and embed documents using LangChain and OpenAI embeddings.
5. **Create** a retrieval-augmented QA chain using FAISS.
6. **Test** functionality while minimizing API token usage.

## Development Tools & Learning Resources

- **LangChain** for building the embedding and retrieval pipelines
- **OpenAI API** for embedding and LLM responses
- **FAISS** for vector storage and similarity search
- **Streamlit** for the web-based interface
- Help from lectures, LangChain documentation, and AI community guides

To manage cost and quota limits during testing, I:
- Cached embeddings locally
- Mocked responses during interface debugging
- Limited input sizes and test queries

Canvas LMS Chatbot Assistant

Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload Canvas LMS documents (e.g., syllabi, schedules, policies) and ask natural language questions about the content. The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate responses grounded in the uploaded documents.

It‚Äôs built using LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, FAISS, and Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

---

Project Objectives

- Provide students with an intuitive way to access course documents using natural language.
- Apply retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to education-specific use cases.
- Develop a reproducible framework for building course-specific chatbots using LangChain and OpenAI.

---

Features

- Upload one or more Canvas LMS documents (PDF or .txt).
- Ask free-form questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the attendance policy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhen is the final project due?‚Äù
- Retrieves context-relevant answers from the uploaded materials using FAISS vector search.
- Interface hosted with Streamlit for ease of use.

How It Works

1. Uploaded files are split into chunks using LangChain's document loaders.
2. Chunks are embedded using OpenAI's embeddings and stored in a FAISS vector database.
3. When a user submits a query, relevant chunks are retrieved via semantic similarity.
4. The query and retrieved context are passed to an OpenAI language model to generate a grounded response.
